## Language Settings for the month

Due to the currently unavailable feature for multilingual dates in ``.Date`` from
Go. It is possible to create a ``month.yaml`` in the data folder of your
Hugo site root directory. There is also an example file in
``exampleSite/data/``.

```sh
cat > month.yaml << EOF
