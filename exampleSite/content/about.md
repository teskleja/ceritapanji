Hey, I'm Panjiâ€”a word lover. I spend my time getting lost in stories, whether I'm writing them or just soaking up someone else's words.

I've got three cats who think they're in charge and a little dude, my son, who keeps me on my toes. They're like my little posse, always around when I'm doing my writing thing.

So, stick around and join me on this blog ride where nerdy book stuff, wanderlust, and random stuff all come together. Cheers!
